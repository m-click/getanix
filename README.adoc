Getanix knows the magic recipe to bootstrap a portable Nix-based environment.

== Introduction

If you want to create a declarative and reproducible development
environment for your project, Nix is a very good choice. However, to
share that with other team members, wouldn't it be great if they could
use that environment without having to install Nix or NixOS, perhaps
without even knowing anything about Nix at all? Ideally, they would
just download and unpack a single directory, which they can unpack
anywhere they like, move around freely, and which contains everything
they need to work on your project.

Depending on your background, you might immediately think either
"Great, I'll provide a virtual machine!" or "Great, I'll provide a
container!". But then, wouldn't it be even more convenient if the
others didn't have to bother with VirtualBox or Qemu, and if they
didn't have to know anything about Docker or Podman? What if you could
use a container that is so lightweight that it adds zero startup and
runtime overhead, and so tiny that you can just ship it as part of
your environment? Wouldn't our development and deployment be a lot
easier if we could get along with just a tiny sandbox like
Bubblewrap?

It seems that setting this up should be easily possible, especially
with Nix, given the large amount of automation and convenience
functions in Nix and especially Nixpkgs.  Still, creating such a
package is more involved than expected.  Everything is almost there,
almost, but not quite yet, not completely, and certainly not seamless.

Getanix is there to fill in the gaps, and provides everything as a
single, convenient tool.

More precisely, Getanix is a portable Nix environment, as well as a
library to create your own environments. Everything is written in the
Nix language, as proper Nix derivations, for a seamless development,
being able to bootstrap itself in the most convenient way.

== Basic usage

=== First incarnation

Let's start by entering one of your projects for which you want to
create a declarative and reproducible development environment. If you
don't have one at hand, just start from scratch with an empty project
directory:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a first step, we will create a simple development environment with
Asciidoctor, Bash, some typical Unix tools, Nix and Python. Note how
we are pinning the current Nixpkgs version as well as the Getanix
version with the respective cryptographic hash:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
cat >example-env.nix <<'EOF'
let
  pkgs = import (builtins.fetchTarball {
    url = "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/63dacb46bf939521bdc93981b4cbb7ecb58427a0.tar.gz";
    sha256 = "1lr1h35prqkd1mkmzriwlpvxcb34kmhc9dnr48gkm8hh089hifmx";
  }) { config = {}; overlays = []; };
  getanix = import (pkgs.fetchurl {
    url = "https://github.com/m-click/getanix/raw/refs/tags/0.2/default.nix";
    hash = "sha256-sX10Oa9AH7ueyCuDv+jrmSh0gBRMTkBcN8NPGtEeOlA=";
  }) { inherit pkgs; };
in
rec {
  env = getanix.mkEnv {
    packages = [
      pkgs.asciidoctor
      pkgs.bashInteractive
      pkgs.coreutils
      pkgs.findutils
      pkgs.nix
      pkgs.python3
    ];
  };
}
EOF
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are unsure about the exact Nix package names of your project
dependencies, just have a look at the NixOS Search:

_________________________________
https://search.nixos.org/packages
_________________________________

Since our description is a `.nix` file, we need the Nix tool to build
our environment. Nix will be part of our environment, but that is not
yet built. So we have a classic chicken-and-egg problem and need to
bootstrap ourselves. We can use any Nix tool or NixOS system for that
purpose, but for the sake of demonstration, let's assume that we can't
or don't want to install Nix. The most convenient option is then the
portable `getanix-env` which we can download, verify and unpack as
follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -#LOf https://github.com/m-click/getanix/releases/download/0.2/getanix-env.tgz \
  && echo 12f7ae5440e3a225116a8e90341b43d09ba2a1ed920f9277ae9abde231051399 getanix-env.tgz | sha256sum -c \
  && tar xf getanix-env.tgz
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The last command will unpack a subdirectory `.envroot` that contains a
local Nix store, as well as an entry program `env`. The latter is
actually a symlink, as the original file is also in the
store.

After unpacking, this environment is ready to use. We don't need to
install or setup anything. We can unpack it anywhere, and move it
around freely. There is one caveat, though: Deletion is a bit
cumbersome, because the files and directories in a Nix store are
always read-only. So we need to execute `chmod -R u+w .envroot` before
we can delete it.

Now let's build the first incarnation of our example environment:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
./env nix-build example-env.nix -o example-env
----------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Running some commands

As usual in Nix, the new environment resides in the same Nix store (in
`.envroot`) and reuses as much as possible from the first one. A new
symlink `example-env` is created and points to the new environment. It
can be used the same way as the first environment, that is, just
prefix your commands with the environment:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
./example-env asciidoctor --version
./example-env python --version
----------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Running a shell

Since our environment contains `bashInteractive`, we can also launch a
local shell:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
./example-env bash
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Compared to `nix-shell`, this one always starts immediately, but is
nevertheless reasonably sandboxed. In particular, only files in the
current directory and subdirectories are reachable, as well as the
environment itself. This is to prevent accidential dependencies on the
surrounding system.

=== Second incarnation

Our new environment also contains Nix, so we can use it to build
itself. Since we didn't change our `example-env.nix` so far,
`nix-build` will notice that there is nothing to do. It produces an
identical environment and even produces the exact same symlink:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
./example-env nix-build example-env.nix -o new-example-env
readlink example-env new-example-env
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We can now replace the bootstrapping `env` with our new `example-env`,
but we will keep the old one as `old-env` just to be safe:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
mv env old-env
mv example-env env
----------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Updating the env

Let's now add some Python packages to our example environment:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
patch example-env.nix <<'EOF'
@@ -0,3 +0,7 @@
       pkgs.nix
-      pkgs.python3
+      (pkgs.python3.withPackages (ps: [
+        ps.httpx
+        ps.pillow
+        ps.psycopg2
+      ]))
     ];
EOF
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you aren't familiar with `withPackages` and friends, please have a
look at the Nixpkgs Reference Manual chapter "Languages and
frameworks":

______________________________________________________________
https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#chap-language-support
______________________________________________________________

We can again rebuild it, check if it works, and replace our old one:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
./env nix-build example-env.nix -o new-env
./env python3 -c 'import httpx'     # fails
./new-env python3 -c 'import httpx' # works
mv env old-env
mv new-env env
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To summarize, we just created a development environment that contains
everything we need to work on the project, as well as everything we
need to work on the environment itself. Neat!

=== Distributing and integrating the env

Now we want to provide our new environment to other people working on
the project, in a convenient way, just a single compressed tar archive
with all runtime dependencies of `env`, ready to be unpacked and to be
used immediately. So we want to create something similar to
`getanix-env` package, but pre-populated with everything we need.

If you wonder why we only want the *runtime* and not the *build*
dependencies of `env` for our development environment, please keep in
mind that the *build* dependencies of `env` were just needed to build
`env`, not to build your project. In other words, the *runtime*
dependencies of `env` are the *build* dependencies of your project.

Now, how to we create this package? Well, we could just tar our `env`
and `.envroot` and call it a day, but that is usually not a good
idea. Our archive would contain tons of unneeded files. We could
reduce that using `nix-store --gc`, but that's cumbersome as it
requires us to provide the correct options and to manage your `gcroot`
properly. Also, we might not want to throw away all build dependencies
of `env` just to be able to distribute it. And finally, what if we are
working with multiple environments using the same store, or are using
an actual NixOS system?

So let's just use the environment description itself to create the
distribution tarball. Everything is prepared for that, we just have to
add the following line to `example-env.nix`:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
patch example-env.nix <<'EOF'
@@ -0,2 +0,3 @@
   };
+  dist.tgz = getanix.mkEnvTgz { inherit env; };
 }
EOF
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that it is important to create a sub-level attribute "dist.tgz"
rather than a top-level attribute like "distTgz". The latter would
have the side effect that `nix-build` by default creates both, the
`env` and the tarball, which is certainly not what we want.

Now we can build this via the `-A` option of `nix-build`:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
./env nix-build example-env.nix -A dist.tgz -o example-env.tgz
----------------------------------------------------------------------

And that's it! We can now upload that archive onto our development
server. Moreover, we could extend our `Makefile` (or whatever build
system we are using) to download, verify and unpack `example-env.tgz`
automatically, and to run all build commands within that environment.

== Advanced topics

=== Closing the loop

Just it case you were wondering: Of course we can close the loop by
using our new environment to rebuild the tiny `getanix-env`:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
./env nix-build https://github.com/m-click/getanix/archive/refs/tags/0.2.tar.gz -o getanix-env-rebuild.tgz
diff -su getanix-env.tgz getanix-env-rebuild.tgz
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The second command will confirm that we just reproduced exactly the
same archive.

=== Separate directory

We might prefer our development system to only write
into a build directory. As it is fully portable, we can just move it
to a more convenient place:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir -p build
mv env .envroot build/
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we can exeute the environment from the new location, and write
updated environments also into that directory:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
./build/env asciidoctor --version
./build/env nix-build example-env.nix -o ./build/new-env
----------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Better compression

If your environment gets larger, switching the tarball's compression from Gzip to Zstandard compression can generate substatial savings:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
patch example-env.nix <<'EOF'
@@ -0,3 +0,3 @@
   };
-  dist.tgz = getanix.mkEnvTgz { inherit env; };
+  dist.tar.zst = getanix.mkEnvTarZst { inherit env; };
 }
EOF
./env nix-build example-env.nix -A dist.tar.zst -o example-env.tar.zst
ls -Lhl example-env.tgz example-env.tar.zst
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that you need the `ls` option `-L` to see the actual archive files rather than the symlinks.

== Limitations

While Getanix is portable in the sense of working at any location of
the filesystem, it is not portable in the sense of running on every
platform:

* As it uses Bubblewrap, it currently only works on Linux.

* `getanix-env.tgz` has only been pre-built for Linux x86_64 so
far, but can in principle be built for any Linux architecture that is
supported by Nix.
